A) Sets up a private repo with a simple main method (hello world).
Runs through gradle, Travis CI, Checkstyle, Spotbugs, and basic test setup.

Summary for Design Pattern:

1. Observer Design Pattern which will create observer classes and notify them 
when a new Codeamon object is created. I wanted this to be on the Attack.java
class but thought it could get messy with all the notifications.

2. Decorator Design Pattern will help with Codeamon evolutions. Since an evolution
resembles a normal Codeamon, I thought this may be a good route for having "special"
Codeamon with advanced features.

3. Singleton Design Pattern will help ensure only one Trainer class gets created at a
time. Almost acts like the Observer class, displaying an ouput whenever a Trainer object
has been created.
