Runs through gradle, Travis CI, Checkstyle, Spotbugs, and basic test setup.

Summary for Design Pattern:

1. Composite Pattern which has different moves a code-a-mon can perform
while in battle. Multiple objects included in one object may feature attack, 
heal,evolve, or switch to another code-a-mon.

2. Factory Pattern to build new code-a-mon or trainers.

3. Observer Pattern will overlook a Battle and observe the objects used in 
the event.

(these may be subject to change if they are too difficult and would like to
try another design pattern)
